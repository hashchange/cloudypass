# The path to the directory must be enclosed in quotes and MUST NOT have a 
# backslash at the end. Is set to "C:\Users\[Username]\Dropbox" by default.

# 
# Examples: 
# - EXCLUDE_FROM_SYNC=("super-secret.kdbx")
# - EXCLUDE_FROM_SYNC=("super-secret.kdbx" "even-more-secret.kdbx" "Strictly Local.kdbx")
