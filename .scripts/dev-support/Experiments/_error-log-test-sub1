# Race #2:
# Error message of sub2 (called above) vs error message of sub1 (echo'ed below).
#
# The error message below may appear BEFORE the error message of sub2. It's asynchronous and a race.
# To ensure proper order, reflecting the order of calls, some amount of time needs to pass,
# otherwise the order of log entries is completely random.
#
# In order to illustrate the race condition and show the reverse ordering, the `tee` command is
# artificially delayed by 0.1s in sub2. (Otherwise, in WSL, the race is tight and results vary.)
